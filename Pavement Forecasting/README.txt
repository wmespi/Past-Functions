Pavement Forecasting Project
- Build Markov Chain forecasting model for a 5 year time horizon
- Builds Markov Chain from state transitions in raw data
- Uses Monte Carlo simulation to generate sample paths for each road segment
- Averages states at each year for each road segment to find point estimate
